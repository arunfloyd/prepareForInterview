Mongo DB

 ◦ Collection :
    - A collection is a grouping of documents.

 ◦ CRUD : 
     - CRUD operations in MongoDB refer to the basic methods used to interact with a MongoDB database.

        - Create: Insert new documents into the MongoDB database. (insertOne,insertMany)
        - Read: Query and retrieve documents from the database. (find,aggregate)
        - Update: Modify existing documents in the database. (updateOne,updateMany,replaceOne)
        - Delete: Remove documents from the database. (deleteOne,deleteMany)

 ◦ Lookup :
      - The $lookup stage in MongoDB performs a left outer join to a collection in the same database.
      - It filters in documents from the "joined" collection for processing.

        - Eg: {
               $lookup: {
               from: <collection to join>,
               localField: <field from the input documents>,
               foreignField: <field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
               as: <output array field> or Alias
               }
             }

 ◦ Unwind :
     - Used to deconstruct an array field from the input documents and create a separate output document 
       for each element in the array

 ◦ In :
     - Used to select documents where the value of a field equals any value in the specified array.
       
       - Syntax : { field: { $in: [<value1>, <value2>, ... <valueN>] } }
       - Eg : db.student.find({language: {$in: ["JavaScript", "CSS"]}}).pretty()
       - In this example, we are retrieving the data of students working with either JavaScript or CSS.

 ◦ Capped collection :
      - Capped collections in MongoDB are fixed-size collections that support high-throughput operations based on insertion order.

      * Capped collections automatically remove the oldest documents to make room for new ones.
      * They have an _id field and an index on the _id field by default.
      * They do not support updates or document deletions, and you cannot shard a capped collection.

    
 ◦ Alias :
      - An Alternative name given to a field in a document within a collection. 
      - Aliases allow you to create temporary field names within aggregation pipelines without modifying the original document structure.

 ◦ Mongo Utilities
      - Tools to help developers manage databases, perform operations, and optimize performance

          - mongodump and mongorestore: These utilities are used for creating backups of MongoDB databases and restoring them.
          - mongoexport and mongoimport: These utilities are used for importing and exporting data in JSON, CSV, or TSV format.
          - mongostat: This utility provides a quick overview of the status of a MongoDB instance, including metrics like connections,
                       operations, memory usage, and more.

 ◦ Indexing :
     - Indexes support efficient execution of queries by allowing MongoDB to limit the number of documents it must scan.
     - Without indexes, MongoDB would need to scan every document in a collection to return query results.
     
            - Single Field Index: Index created on a single field.
            - Compound Index: Index created on multiple fields.
            - Multikey Index: Index used to index content stored in arrays.
            - Geospatial Index : Index created on coordinate system


 ◦ Logical operator :
     - Constructing conditional statements and filtering data based on specific criteria

        - AND 
          - The and operator is used to combine two or more conditions in a way that all conditions must be true for the overall expression to be true.
          - Example: if (condition1 && condition2) { // do something }
        - OR 
          - The or operator is used to combine two or more conditions in a way that at least one of the conditions must be true for the overall expression to be true. 
          - Example: if (condition1 || condition2) { // do something }
        - NOT 
         - The nor operator is a logical operator that combines two conditions and returns true only if both conditions are false.
         - Example: if (!(condition1 || condition2)) { // do something }
        - NOR
         - The nor operator is a logical operator that combines two conditions and returns true only if both conditions are false.
         - Example: if (!(condition1 || condition2)) { // do something }

 ◦ Comparison operator : 
     - Allow developers to compare values within documents and collections to retrieve specific data based on defined criteria.

       - lt (less than): 
        - Example: db.collection.find({ field: { $lt: value } })
       - gt (greater than)
       - eq (equal)
       - ne (not equal):


 ◦ Namespace :
     - Namespaces are used to organize and access data efficiently. 
     - The format of a namespace is <database_name>.<collection_name>

 ◦ addtoSet():
     - Add a value to an array field if the value is not already present. 
     - If the value is already in the array, the addToSet operation does not modify the array.

 ◦ Sharding :
     - Enables efficient data distribution, scalability, and performance in handling large and growing datasets

 ◦ Insert vs save
    - Insert :
       - Used to insert a new document or multiple documents into a collection.
    - Save :
       - Used to insert a new document or update an existing document in a collection.  
       - If the document being saved already contains an _id field, the save operation will update the existing document with the same _id.

 ◦ BSON
    - It stands for Binary JSON, is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents used in MongoDB and other systems.
    - It is designed to be lightweight, traversable, and efficient for storage and data exchange.

 ◦ Data type
    - String: Used to store textual data.
    - Integer: Represents whole numbers.
    - Double: Represents floating-point numbers.
    - Boolean: Stores true or false values.
    - Date: Represents date and time values.
    - Array: Stores an ordered list of values.
    - Object: Represents embedded documents.
    - Null: Represents a null value.
    - Binary Data: Stores binary data.
    - ObjectId: A unique identifier for documents.
    - Timestamp: Stores timestamp values.
    - Decimal128: Represents decimal numbers.
    - Min Key: Represents the smallest possible value.
    - Max Key: Represents the largest possible value.

 ◦ Update operators
    - Set :
       - The $set operator is used to update the value of a field or create a new field if it does not exist.
    - Unset :
       - The $unset operator is used to remove a field from a document.
    - Inc : 
       - The $inc operator is used to increment the value of a field by a specified amount.
   
 ◦ Distinct :
    - Find the unique values for a specified field across a single collection

 ◦ Accumulators :
   - To maintain state as documents progress through the pipeline. Eg:- max min sum avg

 ◦ Count :
   - To determine the number of documents that match a specified query within a collection

 ◦ Out :
   - Used in the context of the aggregation framework to specify the destination collection where the results
     of an aggregation operation should be written to.
   - It allows the results of an aggregation pipeline to be stored in a new or existing collection.

 ◦ findOneAndUpdate : 
   - This method allows you to update a single document based on specified criteria and retrieve either the original or updated document.

 ◦ Replication :
  - The process of synchronizing data across multiple servers to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and data redundancy.
  - It involves maintaining multiple copies of data on different servers, known as replica set members, 
    to provide resilience against hardware failures and to enable read scaling.
  - A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, with one primary node and multiple secondary nodes. 
  - The primary node is the main read-write node that receives all write operations and replicates the data to the secondary nodes.
  - Secondary nodes are read-only copies of the data that replicate changes from the primary node. 
  - In the event of a primary node failure, replica sets support automatic failover, 
    where one of the secondary nodes is automatically elected as the new primary node to ensure continuous operation.

 ◦ Aggregation :
  - Aggregation in MongoDB is a powerful feature that allows you to process and analyze data across multiple documents in a collection.
  - It involves using aggregation pipelines to perform operations such as grouping, filtering, sorting, and transforming data to generate meaningful results
    * An aggregation pipeline is a series of stages that process documents.
    - Common stages include $match, $group, $sort, $project, $limit, and $lookup.
    * MongoDB provides a wide range of aggregation operators to perform specific tasks within the pipeline.
    - Operators like $sum, $avg, $group, $match, $project, and $sort are commonly used for aggregation operations.

 > Sql vs No-Sql
  * SQL Databases: 
  - SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language used to manage and manipulate data in relational database management systems (RDBMS). 
  - SQL databases are based on a structured schema, typically using tables with rows and columns,
    and are known for their ability to handle complex queries and transactions
  * NoSQL Databases: 
  - NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that offer more flexibility in handling unstructured and semi-structured data.
  - They are designed to scale horizontally and are often used in modern, distributed systems.

 > Cursor
  - In MongoDB, when you perform a read operation using methods like db.collection.find(), the result is returned as a cursor.
  - Fetching and processing query results in MongoDB, providing a flexible and efficient way to work with large datasets and perform data operations.

 > upsert
  - Upsert is a database operation that combines the actions of insert and update.
  - When performing an upsert operation, the system will insert a new document if no matching document is found based on a specified filter criteria
  - Eg:
       db.collection.updateOne(
       { name: "Alice" }, // Filter criteria
       { $set: { age: 30 } }, // Update operation
       { upsert: true } // Upsert option
       ) 
   
 > CAP theorem
  - In distributed systems that states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the
    following three guarantees:
    - Consistency: All nodes in the system have the same data at the same time.
    - Availability: The ability of the system to respond to requests even in the presence of faults.
    - Partition Tolerance: The system's ability to function and maintain data consistency even when network partitions occur.

 > Views
  - Is a read-only queryable object whose contents are defined by an aggregation pipeline on other collections or views.
  - They provide a way to create a virtual collection that presents the results of the aggregation pipeline as a collection. 

 > Embedded object :
  - Embedded object refers to a document or subdocument that is nested within another document. 

 > allowdiskuse :
  - Method to allow the aggregation pipeline to write data to temporary files on disk if the pipeline stages consume more than 100 megabytes of RAM.

 > vertical and horizontal scaling
  * Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up): 
   - Vertical scaling involves increasing the capacity of a single server or node by adding more resources, such as CPU, memory, or storage, to the existing system.
  * Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out):
   - Horizontal scaling involves adding more nodes or servers to a system to distribute the load and increase capacity.
   
 > atlas
  - MongoDB Atlas simplifies the process of managing MongoDB databases in the cloud, providing a reliable and scalable solution
    for modern applications that require a flexible and robust database infrastructure.

 > trigger
  - Trigger is a piece of server-side logic that automatically responds to specific database events, such as when a document is inserted, updated, or removed.
  - Triggers can be used to implement complex data interactions and automate tasks based on changes in the database.
  - They are commonly used to enforce data consistency, perform data validation, and execute custom business logic in response to database events.

 > GridFS
  - GridFS is a specification for storing and retrieving large files in MongoDB.
  - It is a way to store files that exceed the BSON document size limit of 16 MB by dividing them into smaller chunks
    and storing each chunk as a separate document in a collection.
  - GridFS is commonly used for storing and managing files such as images, videos, audio files, and other large binary data in MongoDB.

 > bitwise operator
  - Bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on integer values within the database.
  - These operators allow you to manipulate individual bits of integer values, which can be useful for various bitwise operations such as setting,
    clearing, or toggling specific bits within a field.

  * The `bit` operator is used to perform bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operations on integer fields in the documents of a collection. 
    - It allows you to update specific bits of integer fields based on a given bitmask  

     - Eg:- 
        db.collection.updateMany(
                      { _id: 1 },
                      { $bit: { field: { and: 5, or: 3, xor: 6 } } }
                                 )
  * Bitwise Query Operators: MongoDB also provides bitwise query operators, such as $bitsAllSet, $bitsAnySet, and $bitsAllClear,
                             which allow you to query documents based on the presence or absence of specific bits in integer fields.
     - Eg :- 
        db.collection.find({ field: { $bitsAllSet: 5, $bitsAllClear: 3 } })         
        
                         
Javascript


 ✓ DOM
  - The DOM is a programming interface that represents the structure of a document, such as HTML, as a tree of objects.
  - Each node in the tree represents a part of the document, like elements, attributes, or text.
  - The DOM tree is a hierarchical representation of an HTML or XML document.
  - It consists of a root node (the document itself) and child nodes representing elements, attributes, and text content.

 ✓ Event Listener
  - The Event Listener in web development is a mechanism that allows you to listen for specific events,
    such as user interactions (like clicks, mouse movements, key presses) or system events (like page load, window resize).
  - When an event occurs, a function or callback is triggered to respond to that event.

 ✓ Closure
  - Closures in JavaScript are a powerful feature that allows functions to retain access to variables from their containing scope.
  - Understanding closures is essential for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable JavaScript code.

 ✓ Scope and types of scope
  - Scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables, objects, and functions within different parts of the code
    - Global Scope: Global variables are accessible from anywhere in the code, including inside functions, conditional statements,
                    and loops.
    - Function Scope: They are only accessible within the function in which they are declared.
    - Block Scope: Variables declared with let and const have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block in which they are defined.             

 ◦ Array methods
  - Some of the most commonly used array methods include push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), concat(), join(), slice(), splice(), map(), filter(), reduce(),
     and forEach().
 ◦ String methods
  - Most commonly used string methods include charAt(), charCodeAt(), concat(), includes(), indexOf(), slice(), toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(),
    trim(), and replace(). 
 ◦ Array cloning
  - Using the Spread Operator (...) ,Using the slice() Method ,Using the concat() Method,Using the Array.from() Method 

 ◦ Callback
  - A function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after a specific task is completed. 
 ◦ Callback hell
  - Callback hell, also known as the "pyramid of doom," is a common issue in JavaScript programming that arises when multiple 
    nested callbacks are used, leading to code that is difficult to read, maintain, and debug.
  - This situation occurs when asynchronous operations are chained together, resulting in deeply nested callback functions within each other.

 ◦ Currying
  - Currying in JavaScript is a functional programming technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of nested functions,
    each taking a single argument.
  - This process allows for partial application of functions and creates higher-order functions

 ◦ Memoization
  - Memoization is a technique used in computer science to optimize the performance of functions by caching the results of expensive function calls
    and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
  - This can help reduce redundant computations and improve the overall efficiency of the program.
  
 ◦ Promise , promise methods
  - Promises in JavaScript are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
  - They provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous code compared to traditional callback functions. 

     - Promise.resolve(): Creates a resolved promise with a given value.
     - Promise.reject(): Creates a rejected promise with a given reason for rejection.
     - Promise.all(): Takes an iterable of promises and returns a single Promise that resolves when all of the promises have resolved.
     - Promise.race(): Takes an iterable of promises and returns a single Promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises resolves or rejects.
     - Promise.then(): Attaches callbacks for the resolution and rejection of the Promise.
     - Promise.catch(): Attaches a callback for only the rejection of the Promise.
     - Promise.finally(): Attaches a callback that is executed when the Promise is settled, whether it is fulfilled or rejected.

 ◦ Arrow function
  - Arrow functions in JavaScript are a concise way to write function expressions.
  - They provide a more compact syntax compared to traditional function expressions and come with some semantic differences and limitations in usage.

 ◦ Types of conversion - int, parse
  - Implicit Conversion: Also known as automatic type conversion, this occurs when JavaScript automatically 
                         converts one data type to another to perform an operation.
  - Explicit Conversion: Also known as manual type conversion, this involves converting data types as per specific
                         needs using built-in methods or functions.                      
     
 ◦ Prototype
  - The prototype is a fundamental concept related to how objects inherit properties and methods from other objects.
  - Every object in JavaScript has a prototype, which is itself an object.
  - When you try to access a property or method of an object, and it's not found in the object itself, 
    JavaScript looks for it in the object's prototype and continues up the prototype chain until it reaches the end.

 ◦ Class , object, object methods
  - A class is a blueprint for creating objects with similar properties and methods.
  - It defines the structure and behavior that the objects will have.
  - Objects are instances of classes, and they inherit the properties and methods defined in the class.

 ◦ Object destructuring
  - Object destructuring in JavaScript is a convenient way to extract multiple properties from an object and assign them to variables.

 ◦ Variable typing
  - Variable typing in JavaScript refers to the way data types are handled when working with variables. 
  - JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables are not bound to a specific data type.
  - Instead, the data type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the type of value it holds

 ◦ Rest 
  - The rest operator is used to collect the remaining arguments into an array. 
  - It is used in function parameters to gather all the remaining parameters into a single array.

 ◦ Spread 
  - Spread operator is used to expand an iterable (such as an array, object, or string) into individual elements. 
  - It is used in function calls or array literals to spread the elements of an iterable.

 ◦ Call 
 ◦ Apply 
 ◦ Bind
 ◦ Shadowing 
  - It occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope, effectively 
    "shadowing" the outer variable within that inner scope.

 ◦ IIFE
  - An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a JavaScript function that is defined and executed immediately after its creation.
  - IIFEs are commonly used to create private scopes, prevent variable name collisions, and encapsulate code.
  - They are particularly useful for maintaining data privacy and avoiding global scope pollution.

 > fisrt class fn
  - In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be:

      - Assigned to variables
      - Passed as arguments to other functions
      - Returned from other functions
      - Stored in data structures

 > bracket notation
  - // Accessing properties using dot notation
       console.log(person.name); // Output: "Alice"
  - // Accessing properties using bracket notation
       console.log(person["name"]); // Output: "Alice"

 > try catch
  - The try...catch statement in JavaScript is used to handle exceptions (errors) that occur within a block of code. 
  - It allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while providing a way to handle the error if one occurs.

 > pure order fn
  - emphasizing predictability, testability, and the absence of side effects. 
  - By adhering to the principles of pure functions, developers can write more robust and maintainable code.

 > call by value vs call by refrence
  - In call by value, a copy of the actual parameter's value is passed to the function.
  - The function works with this copy, and any modifications made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original value.
  
  - In call by reference, a reference to the actual parameter is passed to the function.
  - This means that the function can directly modify the original parameter, and any changes made inside the function are reflected in the original value.

 > recursive fn
  - A recursive function is a function that calls itself within its own definition.
  - This technique is commonly used in programming to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.

 > primitive and non primitive
  - Primitive data types are the most basic data types available in a programming language.
  - They are predefined by the language and directly operate on the actual values.
    - Numbers (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers)
    - Strings (sequences of characters)
    - Booleans (true or false)
    - Undefined (a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value)
    - Null (represents the intentional absence of any object value)
    - Symbols (unique and immutable data type introduced in ECMAScript 6)

  - Non-primitive data types are more complex data types that are created by the programmer and are not defined by the programming language itself.
    - Objects (collections of key-value pairs)
    - Arrays (ordered collections of values)
    - Functions (blocks of reusable code)
    - Dates (representing dates and times)
    - Any other object that is not of a primitive type  

 > Temporal dead zone
  - The temporal dead zone (TDZ) is a specific period in the execution of JavaScript code where variables declared with let and const exist
    but cannot be accessed or assigned any value.
  - During this phase, accessing or using the variable will result in a ReferenceError.

 > Higher order fn
  - HigherOrderFunction is a higher-order function that takes callbackFunction as an argument and executes it within its body. 
  - This allows for dynamic behavior where different functions can be passed to higherOrderFunction to achieve different results.

 > this keyword
  - this refers to the object that the method is attached to, allowing the same method to be reused on different objects.
 
 > escape seaquence
  - Escape sequences are essential for handling special characters and formatting in code
     - \n: Newline
     - \t: Tab
     - \\: Backslash
     - \": Double quote
     - \': Single quote

Node, Express


 ◦ Patch & put
   - GET: The GET method is used to retrieve data from the server.
          It is a read-only method, meaning it does not change or mutate data on the server.
          GET requests are safe and idempotent, making them suitable for fetching data. 

   - POST: POST is used to create new resources on the server.
           It is commonly used to create subordinate resources under a parent resource.
           POST requests are not idempotent and are suitable for non-idempotent operations    

   - PUT: PUT is primarily used for updating existing resources on the server.
          When making a PUT request, the entire resource is replaced with the new representation provided in the request body.
          PUT requests are idempotent but not safe    

   - PATCH: PATCH is used to modify existing resources by sending a set of instructions describing how the resource should
            be changed.
            Unlike PUT, PATCH does not require sending the entire resource representation, only the changes.
            PATCH requests are not idempotent. 

   - DELETE: The DELETE method is used to delete a specific resource identified by its URI.
             It removes the resource from the server.
             DELETE requests are idempotent, meaning multiple calls to delete the same resource will have the same result    

 ◦ Idempotence : 

   - Idempotence is a property of certain operations or API requests that ensures repeating the operation multiple times
     will yield the same result as if it was executed only once.
   - This principle is especially vital in distributed systems and APIs, as it helps maintain consistency and
     predictability in situations such as network issues, request retries, or duplicated requests.  

       - GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE are idempotent.
       - POST and PATCH are generally non-idempotent.  

 ◦ Option Method :

   - OPTIONS method is used to query a server about the HTTP methods and other options that are supported for a specific resource.
   - It is a useful tool for clients to understand the capabilities of a server and to make informed requests.
      Eg:  
           Here is an example of an OPTIONS request:
           OPTIONS /resource HTTP/1.1
           Host: example.com

           And a possible response from the server:
           HTTP/1.1 200 OK
           Allow: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

 ◦ Middlewares
  - Middleware functions are essential components that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res),
    and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.
     * Types :
       - Application-level Middleware
           - CORS Middleware
           - Authentication Middleware
       - Router-level Middleware
       - Error-handling Middleware
       - Built-in Middleware
       - Third-party Middleware 

 ◦ Set-immediate
    - The setImmediate function is used to schedule the immediate execution of a callback after the I/O events callbacks 
      and before setTimeout and setInterval.

      Eg:- setImmediate(() => {
           console.log('This will be executed in the next iteration of the event loop');
           });

 ◦ Events :
  - Events in Node.js are a fundamental part of its asynchronous, event-driven architecture.
  - In Node.js, every action is considered an event, such as when a connection is made or a file is opened.
  - Objects in Node.js can emit events, and developers can create, fire, and listen for their own events using 
    the built-in "Events" module.
 
 ◦ Session and cookie
  - Session and cookie management are essential aspects of web development, particularly when building stateful
    and secure web applications.
    Both sessions and cookies are used to maintain user state and identity across multiple requests 
    and are integral to user authentication, personalization, and tracking.
     - Cookies: Cookies are small pieces of data stored in the user's browser. 

 ◦ View engine
  - A view engine is a templating engine that allows you to generate dynamic HTML content by combining static templates with data.
  - Express supports various view engines like EJS, Pug (formerly Jade), Handlebars, and Mustache.

 ◦ status code
  - A status code in the context of web development refers to a three-digit numeric code that is sent by a server in response to a client's request.

     - 1xx: Informational responses
     - 2xx: Success responses
     - 3xx: Redirection responses
     - 4xx: Client error responses
     - 5xx: Server error responses

 ◦ Cors in detail
  - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a security feature implemented in web browsers to control how web pages or web applications on one domain
    can access resources from another domain.
  - It is a critical security mechanism that helps prevent unauthorized access to resources and protects against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
 
 ◦ Body parser : 
  - Body parser is a middleware module for Node.js that is used to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware
    before your handlers, available under the req.body property.
  - It simplifies the process of handling data sent in HTTP requests by parsing the request body 
    and populating the req.body object with the parsed data.

 ◦ Morgan

    - Local Modules : custom modules created by developers
    - Third-party Modules : Npm , yarn

 > node global object
  - The global object in Node.js is similar to the window object in web browsers, but it is specific to the Node.js environment.
  - It provides access to global properties, such as process, console, Buffer, and require, 
    as well as global functions like setTimeout, clearTimeout, setInterval, and clearInterval.

 > json
  - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines 
    to parse and generate.
  - It is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language and is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and
    a web application as an alternative to XML.

 > streams
  - Streams in Node.js are a fundamental concept that allows developers to work with streaming data efficiently.
  - A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js, and it provides a way to handle data piece by piece or in chunks,
    rather than loading the entire dataset into memory at once.
      
      - Readable: Streams from which data can be read.
      - Writable: Streams to which data can be written.
      - Duplex: Streams that are both Readable and Writable.
      - Transform: Duplex streams that can modify or transform the data as it is written and read. 

 > techniques used for streams(piping and chaining)
  - Piping involves connecting the output of one stream to the input of another stream, creating a data flow pipeline.
  - Piping simplifies the process of transferring data between streams without manually handling data chunks and buffering.

  - Chaining involves connecting multiple streams in a sequence to create a chain of stream operations.
  - Chaining allows for complex data processing workflows by connecting streams one after another.

 > libuv
  - Libuv is a multi-platform support library in C that provides asynchronous I/O operations, networking, and other fundamental functionalities for Node.js.
  - It serves as the underlying technology that enables Node.js to achieve its asynchronous and event-driven nature, 
    allowing for efficient handling of I/O operations without blocking the main thread.

 > api
  - Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
  - APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.
  
 > logger 
  - Logging is a crucial aspect of software development, especially in Node.js applications, to track and monitor the behavior of the application.
  - A logger is a component or module used to record events, errors, and other information during the execution of a program.
  - It helps developers troubleshoot issues, analyze performance, and gain insights into the application's behavior. 

 > https 
  - Module provides functionality to create secure HTTPS servers and make secure HTTPS requests.
  - It is an essential part of building secure web applications and APIs in Node.js.

 > nodemon
  - Nodemon is a command-line interface (CLI) utility for Node.js that is designed to automatically restart Node.js applications 
    when file changes are detected.
  - This eliminates the need to manually stop and restart the server each time changes are made to the code,
    which can significantly improve the development workflow.

 > thread pool
  - The thread pool in Node.js plays a crucial role in offloading synchronous and heavy-duty tasks from the main event loop,
    thereby enhancing the performance, scalability, and responsiveness of Node.js applications.
